* Frequency-wave
Frequency-wave is a program that visualizes sound coming from [[http://www.musicpd.org/][MPD]]. It
can do so in three different ways: as a waveform, by plotting
amplitude vs frequency, and by rendering a 3D surface spectogram.

** How to use
*** Dependencies
- [[http://www.musicpd.org/][MPD]]
*** Build dependencies
- [[http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/][freeGLUT]]
- libGL
- libGLU
- [[http://www.fftw.org/][FFTW]]
*** Building
Frequency-wave can be built by running
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make
#+END_SRC
in the root directory of this project.
*** MPD setup
MPD needs to be configured to create a FIFO pipe to which raw samples
will be written during playback. This can be done by adding the
following to your MPD configuration (normally in ~/.mpd/mpd.conf):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
audio_output {
    type                    "fifo"
    name                    "my_fifo"
    path                    "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
    format                  "44100:16:1"
}
#+END_SRC
